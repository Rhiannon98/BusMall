.gitignore and .eslintrc.json from 201 class repo

Max helped me understand the while loop conditions

Timea and Madeline aided in the gradient, even if my gradient is not perfect I still like it

John, Allie, and Andrew helped with minor bugs and getting my code to load into local storage

Honestly, this took less web research than some of the other projects and I am wishing I added more to this
